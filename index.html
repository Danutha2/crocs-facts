Great! Let's proceed with creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files based on the plan, incorporating modern styling, shadows, and animations.

### 1. HTML (index.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Crocodile Facts</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="fact-container">
        <p id="fact-display">Click the button to see a random crocodile fact!</p>
        <button id="new-fact-btn">Show Random Fact</button>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. CSS (styles.css)

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    background-color: #f0f8ff;
}

.fact-container {
    background-color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    max-width: 400px;
    text-align: center;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.fact-container:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
}

#fact-display {
    font-size: 1.2em;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    white-space: nowrap;
}

#new-fact-btn {
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

#new-fact-btn:hover {
    background-color: #45a049;
}
```

### 3. JavaScript (script.js)

```javascript
const facts = [
    "Crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Australia.",
    "They have a powerful bite due to their strong jaw muscles, making them one of the most formidable predators.",
    "Crocodiles are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish, birds, mammals, and occasionally smaller crocodiles.",
    "They can live both in freshwater and saltwater environments, with some species being more adapted to one than the other.",
    "Crocodiles have a lifespan that can exceed 70 years in the wild.",
    "They are known for their ability to stay submerged underwater for up to an hour due to their efficient respiratory system.",
    "Crocodiles have a unique heart structure with four chambers, similar to birds and mammals, which aids in efficient oxygenation.",
    "They communicate through vocalizations, such as growls, hisses, and roars, especially during mating season.",
    "Crocodiles are excellent swimmers, using their tails to propel themselves through the water.",
    "They have a protective bony skin with scales called scutes, which provide armor-like protection."
];

document.getElementById('new-fact-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * facts.length);
    const factDisplay = document.getElementById('fact-display');
    factDisplay.textContent = facts[randomIndex];
    factDisplay.style.animation = 'fadeIn 0.5s';
    setTimeout(() => {
        factDisplay.style.animation = '';
    }, 500);
});
```

### Explanation

- **HTML**: Sets up the basic structure with a container for displaying facts and a button to trigger new facts.
- **CSS**: Provides a modern look with shadows, hover effects, and responsive design. The `overflow` and `text-overflow` properties ensure text doesn't overflow the container.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for displaying random facts and adds a simple fade-in animation when a new fact is shown.

You can now create these files and open `index.html` in a browser to see the application in action. Let me know if you need further assistance!
