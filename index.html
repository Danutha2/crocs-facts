const facts = [
    "Crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Australia.",
    "They have a powerful bite due to their strong jaw muscles, making them one of the most formidable predators.",
    "Crocodiles are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish, birds, mammals, and occasionally smaller crocodiles.",
    "They can live both in freshwater and saltwater environments, with some species being more adapted to one than the other.",
    "Crocodiles have a lifespan that can exceed 70 years in the wild.",
    "They are known for their ability to stay submerged underwater for up to an hour due to their efficient respiratory system.",
    "Crocodiles have a unique heart structure with four chambers, similar to birds and mammals, which aids in efficient oxygenation.",
    "They communicate through vocalizations, such as growls, hisses, and roars, especially during mating season.",
    "Crocodiles are excellent swimmers, using their tails to propel themselves through the water.",
    "They have a protective bony skin with scales called scutes, which provide armor-like protection."
